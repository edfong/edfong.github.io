Hello! I joined the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://saasweb.hku.hk/) at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) as an assistant professor in August 2023.

I was previously a data scientist at Novo Nordisk, where I developed novel statistical methods within the healthcare setting in collaboration with academia. Before that, I completed my PhD at the Department of Statistics, University of Oxford and the Alan Turing Institute, supervised by [Prof. Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/).

Research
======
My current research explores Bayesian methods that are motivated by prediction - this encompasses topics in Bayesian nonparametrics, scalable inference, and model selection. In particular, I find generalized Bayesian procedures to be an exciting avenue of research for tackling issues like scalability and model misspecification. Some examples of these methods include [general Bayesian updating](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.6430.pdf), the [Bayesian bootstrap](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/fong19a/fong19a.pdf) and the [martingale posterior](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15671.pdf). My work also touches on topics in machine learning and conformal prediction, and I've recently started to take an interest in causal inference and its applications in clinical trials, as well as the overlap with Bayesian techniques.


Prospective students
======
I'm looking for motivated PhD students with a strong statistical background to join my group at HKU. Please drop me an email with your CV and research interests if you are interested.
