I will be joining the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://saasweb.hku.hk/) at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) as an assistant professor in August 2023.

I was previously a data scientist at Novo Nordisk, where I developed novel statistical methods within the healthcare setting in collaboration with academia. Before that, I completed my PhD at the Department of Statistics, University of Oxford and the Alan Turing Institute, supervised by [Professor Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/).

Research
======
I am broadly interested in Bayesian inference, machine learning and causal inference. In particular:
- Bayesian prediction
- Bayesian nonparametrics
- Scalable Bayesian inference
- Conformal prediction
- Causal inference
- Applications in clinical trials and observational data

News
