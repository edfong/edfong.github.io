title: "On the marginal likelihood and cross-validation"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'We show that the marginal likelihood is formally equivalent to exhaustive leave-p-out crossvalidation averaged over all values of p and all held-out test sets when using the log posterior predictive probability as the scoring rule. Moreover, the log posterior predictive score is the only coherent scoring rule under data exchangeability.'
